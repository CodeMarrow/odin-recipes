    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Authentic, Vietnamese pho soup is all about the broth! Beef bones, fish
      sauce, star anise, and ginger simmer for at least 6 hours, creating a
      complex, aromatic broth that may not be quick, but it's certainly
      delicious. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly
      sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.
